# THE GEM
 State of the art GROW LED light w. current injection 25amp
 
 This is a PAR light project based on the high-current controller M4SUBDRV (https://github.com/Juanduino/THE-DIMMER_M4SDRV_V1)
 
 One controller can inject current into 5 seperate channels of up yo 6 amp per channel. 
 
 The goal of the project is to make a smart plant grow light, which controlles the light intensity based on temperature sensor imput.
 
 By making the lamp output temperature controlled, the final capacity of the lamp depends on the amount of cooling applied.
